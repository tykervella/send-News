If something catches their eye, click "Read More" to open the article up and read its content. The user will see a modal pop up that has the complete article. On this screen, the user can save articles by clicking "Add to Favorite" or they could choose to visit the original publication by clicking on "Link."

Whether viewing the main page or looking at a specific article, the user can click "Play" to have an article read aloud to them! The program will start by reading the article's description before moving on to the content. To stop the program from reading aloud the user clicks "Pause," or they can just press "Play" on a different article. 

Favorited articles are saved in local storage and displayed on the left side of the main webpage. The first three words of the title are displayed as links. When clicking on a favorited article, the user is directed to the article's original publication so they can read the article again. The user can additionally press "Clear All Favorites" to empty local storage and delete all of their saved articles.
